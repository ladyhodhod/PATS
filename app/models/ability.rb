  def initialize(user)
    # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
    #
      user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)

    if user.role? :vet
      can :manage, :all # run all CRUD operations for all the models
    end 

    # elsif user.role? :assistant
    #   can :manage, Owner
    #   can :manage, Pet

    #   can :read, Medicine
    #   can :read, Dosage
    #   can :read, :Procedure
    # end











    #   if user.admin?
    #     can :manage, :all

    #     can :read, :all
    #   end
    #
    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true
